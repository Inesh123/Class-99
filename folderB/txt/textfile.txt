The St. Croix macaw (Ara autocthones) is an extinct species of macaw whose remains have been found
on the Caribbean islands of St. Croix and Puerto Rico. It was a medium-sized macaw of unknown coloration,
slightly larger than the extinct Cuban macaw. It was described in 1937 based on a tibiotarsus leg bone (pictured)
unearthed from a kitchen midden at a pre-Columbian site on St. Croix. A second specimen consisting of various bones
from a similar site on Puerto Rico was described in 2008, and a coracoid from Montserrat may belong to this or another
extinct species of macaw. The St. Croix macaw is one of 13 extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived
on the Caribbean islands. Macaws were frequently transported for long distances by humans in both prehistoric and
historic times, so it is impossible to know whether species only known from bones or written accounts were native or imported species.
